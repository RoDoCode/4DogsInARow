# Connect 4 - Canine Edition

'Connect 4 - Canine Edition' is a website that aims to offer fun gameplay with increasing levels of challenge. The website is themed around my own two dogs. Porgie & Kipper and their endless struggle for dominance. It's a themeatic twist on the familiar connect 4. The website is geared as a gift for my neice, Freya.

The target audience is a single individual, Freya. Freya is 5, nearly 6, and loves dogs, Porgie & Kipper in particular. She has a short attention span and loves games. She plays games alone but prefers to play with someone else.  

'Connect 4 - Canine Edition' includes a standard 6 x 7 grid version, and a 9 x 11 more challenging mode. The game is a 2 player turn based race to connect 4 adjacent dog tokens of the same type in a row. The game allows players to enter their names before starting play. There is a turn counter which counts the number of turns before the game is completed and there is a player score counter which tracks the number of wins for each player.

Freya is 5, so the content is styled to be appealing to her aesthetic tastes and all content is made accessible, intuitive and responsibly. A player only needs to be able to type their own name, be able to read simple sentences and have some spatial awareness within a digital space.

## Design

![Design Example Image](assets/images/screenshots/design.JPG)

### Imagery

The images are either stock symbols and textures with accurate credits attributed or they are my own photographs edited to create game assets. 

### Colours

The colour scheme of 'Connect 4 - Canine Edition' is meant to evoke feelings of dogs in a field, using greens, with pops of light bright colours reminiscent of flowers in a meadow. This matches the styling of a lot of other childrens television and games, so the user intuitively recognises the context. This colour scheme requires careful curation so a high contrast between text and backgrounds for easy on screen reading is still maintained.

### Fonts

The Lato and Oswald fonts are the two fonts used across the website. Both are imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Sans Serif is the backup font, this allows the site cope with any import or compatibility issues with GoogleFonts.

## Wireframes

Balsamiq was use to generate the wireframes.

### Setup Page

Home, Gallery, Timeline, Articles - users come to the site with different levels of familiarity with the content so a range of different ways to navigate the content are crucial. Some allow the user to absorb and understand the content slowly as they navigate so that each section ahead makes sense while others are more direct for those that know what they are looking for.
