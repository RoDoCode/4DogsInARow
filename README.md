# Connect 4 - Canine Edition

'Connect 4 - Canine Edition' is a website that aims to offer fun gameplay with increasing levels of challenge as you and your opponent improve. The website is themed around my own two dogs. Porgie & Kipper and their endless struggle for dominance. It's a themeatic twist on the familiar connect 4. The website is geared as a gift for my neice, Freya.

The target audience is a single individual, Freya. Freya is 5, nearly 6, and loves dogs, Porgie & Kipper in particular. She has a short attention span and loves games. She plays games alone but prefers to play with someone else.  

'Connect 4 - Canine Edition' includes a standard 6 x 7 grid version. The game is a 2 player turn based race to connect 4 adjacent dog tokens of the same type in a row. The game allows players to enter their names before starting play. There is a player score counter which tracks the number of wins for each player.

Freya is 5, so the content is styled to be appealing to her aesthetic tastes and all content is made accessible, intuitive and responsibly. A player only needs to be able to type their own name, be able to read simple sentences and have some spatial awareness within a digital space.

## Design

![Design Example Image](assets/images/pics/Capture4.PNG)

### Imagery

The images are either stock symbols and textures with accurate credits attributed or they are my own photographs edited to create game assets.

### Colours

The colour scheme of 'Connect 4 - Canine Edition' is meant to evoke feelings of dogs in a field, using veridian green, rgb(64, 130, 109), with pops of light bright colours reminiscent of flowers in a meadow and complimentary, #d65e18. This matches the styling of a lot of other childrens television and games, so the user intuitively recognises the context. This colour scheme requires careful curation so a high contrast between text and backgrounds for easy on screen reading is still maintained.

### Fonts

The Gluten font is used across the website. It is imported from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Sans Serif is the backup font, this allows the site cope with any import or compatibility issues with GoogleFonts.

## Wireframes

Balsamiq was use to generate the wireframes.

## Features

### Landing Page

This section introduces the user to ENIGMA with eye catching images to grab their attention and guide them on through the site. The page gives the user a rapid understanding of what the site is about and how they can use it. Users are met by a hero image with brief text introducing an interest and key element of the overall Enigma narrative.
There are different types of articles arrayed in several different sections to allow the user to feel how best they would like to learn.

### Setup Page

Home, Gallery, Timeline, Articles - users come to the site with different levels of familiarity with the content so a range of different ways to navigate the content are crucial. Some allow the user to absorb and understand the content slowly as they navigate so that each section ahead makes sense while others are more direct for those that know what they are looking for.

![Setup Page Image](assets/images/pics/landing2.PNG)

### Game Page

A collection of images with clear descriptions with hyperlinks to relevant pages where users can learn more. The images themselves are large and detailed, they are meant to be inspiring and interesting in and of themselves; a rare glimpse into the past.

![Game Page Image](assets/images/pics/landing3.PNG)

### The Header

The footer section includes links to relevant social media sites for Enigma . The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
The footer also include site navigation links so users don't have to scroll to the top of the page.

### Features to Implement in the Future

- Variable board size: this would allow players to change the shape of the board, increasing difficulty.
- Very simple AI for single player: this could have been done using a random number generator or mimicking the players moves to put a piece down next to theirs, so the AI plays defensively always trying to head off the players tactics. Maybe a tighter version of the win conditions looking for pairs of two and three to anticipate attempted wins, then the ai places its piece ahead to cut the player off.
- Highscores Page which tracks past players highest scores.
- Individual turn tracking for fastest win competing.
- Music

- I also used the following websites to test responsiveness:

  - [Am I Responsive](https://ui.dev/amiresponsive?url=https://rodocode.github.io/Connect4-CanineEdition/game.html)

![Connect 4 - Canine Edition Am I Responsive Gallery Image](assets/images/pics/Capture.PNG)  

### User Testing

Test users have been used and observed playing the game and testing th functions to find any bugs.

### Bugs list

- After incorporating the form values as active elements in the JS code the win condition for playrr two became 5 aligned matching divs in stead of 4. The game is connect 4, not connect 5, so this simply would do. This didnt effect player one. Player two also became the first to lay a tile unexpectedly. The bug was fixed by reverting to standard RED/YELLOW names to represent player one and two in code and passing their names value from the form separately into another variable which is used for in-game text.
- Hyperlinks in the buttons were only working when text was clicked, not the button itself. The links inside the button text field were removed and an inline attribute onclick was added as standard. This also mede styling the text of the button much easier.
- Score tracker wfist showed undefined, and after a fix to this it showed only 0. Score Updating function had to be written to clear the page and update with a new score after a win condition is found.

### Unfixed Bugs

- There is currently no end condition if the players reach a stalemate. While this does not effect gameplay as the rows are all full which stops any further play or bugs, and no win condition is reached so the scores are not changed by a draw, and there is a reset button permanently present for just such an occasion; I would still have prefered to create a draw status which is declared. Time was against me, maybe ill add it in the future.
